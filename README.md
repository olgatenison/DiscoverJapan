## Technologies Used

Discover Japan is built using a variety of modern web technologies to create a fully responsive and visually appealing landing page. Here are the key technologies employed in this project:

- **HTML5:** The structure of the web page is created using the latest HTML standard, ensuring a semantically correct and well-organized layout.

- **CSS3:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) are used to style the page, providing a visually appealing and consistent design across different devices and screen sizes. Techniques like Flexbox and Grid are utilized for responsive layouts.

- **BEM (Block-Element-Modifier):** The BEM methodology is employed to maintain a clean and maintainable CSS codebase. It promotes modular and reusable styles, making it easier to manage and scale the project.

- **Responsive Design:** The page is designed with a responsive approach, ensuring that it looks and functions well on a variety of devices, including web browsers, tablets, and mobile phones. Media queries and flexible layouts are used to achieve responsiveness.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience and add interactivity to the website. For smaller screens, a burger menu is implemented to improve navigation on mobile devices.

This combination of HTML5, CSS3, BEM, responsive design, and JavaScript ensures that Discover Japan provides an engaging and accessible user experience across different platforms and screen sizes.
